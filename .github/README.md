# notakrista.com

My personal website hosted on Github Pages, generated and heavily based of [HydePHP](hydephp.com) website template.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1
- Composer
- Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/akrista/notakrista.com`
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Compile the assets with `npm run dev` or `npm run prod`
5. Run the development server with `php hyde serve -host=0.0.0.0`

After following these steps, you should be able to access the website at `http://localhost:8000` or `http://your.ip.address:8000`.

### Formatting, Upgrading & Refactoring

You can format the code with the following command `composer pint`. Also, you could "upgrade" or "refactor" the code using rector with the command `composer rector`.

## To Do
